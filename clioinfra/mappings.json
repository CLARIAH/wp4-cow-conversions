These deposits are commonly referred to as \"direct shipping ores\" or \"natural ores\".

Tin is a relatively scarce element with an abundance in the earth's crust of about 2 parts per million (ppm), compared with 94 ppm for zinc, 63 ppm for copper, and 12 ppm for lead. Most of the world's tin is produced from placer deposits; at least one-half comes from Southeast Asia. The only mineral of commercial importance as a source of tin is cassiterite (SnO2), although small quantities of tin are recovered from complex sulfides such as stannite, cylindrite, franckeite, canfieldite, and teallite.\r\n\r\nMost tin is used as a protective coating or as an alloy with other metals such as lead or zinc. Tin is used in coatings for steel containers, in solders for joining pipes or electrical/electronic circuits, in bearing alloys, in glass-making, and in a wide range of tin chemical applications. Secondary, or scrap, tin is an important source of the tin supply.\r\n"], "skos:note": "Tin mine production (1000 metric tons)"}}, "http://datasets.socialhistory.org/api/access/datafile/100": {"datafile": {"originalFormatLabel": "UNKNOWN", "contentType": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet", "name": "Labourers_wage-historical.xlsx", "filename": "1519c891a24-4c28a1475553", "id": 100, "md5": "537a5731c3695e39ce6e2b5815ece267"}, "datasetVersionId": 32, "title": "Labourers Real Wage", "label": "Labourers_wage-historical.xlsx", "version": 1, "metadata": {"prov:wasDerivedFrom": [{"@id": "http://hdl.handle.net/10622/QK8VRF"}], "dc:title": "Labourers Real Wage", "dc:description": ["The building labourers\u2019 real wage is given annually for the period 1850-2010.

Early uses of lead included building materials, pigments for glazing ceramics, and pipes for transporting water.   The castles and cathedrals of Europe contain considerable quantities of lead in decorative fixtures, roofs, pipes, and windows.   Prior to the early 1900s, uses of lead in the United States were primarily for ammunition, brass, burial vault liners, ceramic glazes, leaded glass and crystal, paints or other protective coatings, pewter, and water lines and pipes.   The advent of the electrical age and communications, which were accelerated by technological developments in World War I, resulted in the addition of bearing metals, cable covering, caulking lead, solders, and type metal to the list of lead uses.   With the growth in production of public and private motorized vehicles and the associated use of starting-lighting-ignition (SLI) lead-acid storage batteries and terne metal for gas tanks after World War I, demand for lead increased.   Most of these uses for lead continued to increase with the growth in population and the national economy.   Contributing to the increase in demand for lead was the use of lead as radiation shielding in medical analysis and video display equipment and as an additive in gasoline.\r\nBy the mid-1980s, a significant shift in lead end-use patterns had taken place.   Much of this shift was a result of the U.S. lead consumers compliance with environmental regulations that significantly reduced or eliminated the use of lead in nonbattery products, including gasoline, paints, solders, and water systems.   More recently, as the use of lead in nonbattery products has continued to decline, the demand for lead in SLI-type batteries has continued to grow.   In addition, the demand for lead in non-SLI battery applications also has continued to grow.   Non-SLI battery applications include motive sources of power for industrial forklifts, airport ground equipment, mining equipment, and a variety of nonroad utility vehicles, as well as stationary sources of power in uninterruptible electric power systems for hospitals, computer and telecommunications networks, and load-leveling equipment for electric utility companies.   By the early 2000s, the total demand for lead in all types of lead-acid storage batteries represented 88% of apparent U.S. lead consumption.   Other significant uses included ammunition (3%), oxides in glass and ceramics (3%), casting metals (2%), and sheet lead (1%).   The remainder was consumed in solders, bearing metals, brass and bronze billets, covering for cable, caulking lead, and extruded products.\r\n"], "skos:note": "Lead mine production (in 1000 metric tons, lead content)"}}, "http://datasets.socialhistory.org/api/access/datafile/27": {"datafile": {"originalFormatLabel": "UNKNOWN", "contentType": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet", "name": "competition-historical.xlsx", "filename": "1519b3ff025-20ceeaa98f70", "id": 27, "md5": "d753f3b31bb033e38f5ffd16d33dd357"}, "datasetVersionId": 8, "title": "Political Competition", "label": "competition-historical.xlsx", "version": 1, "metadata": {"prov:wasDerivedFrom": [{"@id": "http://hdl.handle.net/10622/4ZDPWP"}], "dc:title": "Political Competition", "dc:description": ["Component of Vanhanen\u2019s polyarchy index.

Due to historical data availability only a selective set of pressures (cropland and grazing) is included here. This dataset  therefore gives an overestimation of remaining biodiversity or naturalness, as compared to other studies in which the GLOBIO approach was used for the more recent time periods, e.g. Environmental Data Compendium (http://www.compendiumvoordeleefomgeving.nl/) and the Global Biodiversity Outlook4 (https://www.cbd.int/gbo4/. GLOBIO3 is built on a set of equations linking environmental drivers and biodiversity impact (cause\u2013effect relationships). Cause\u2013effect relationships are derived from available literature using meta-analyses. GLOBIO3 describes biodiversity as the remaining mean species abundance (MSA) of original species, relative to their abundance in pristine or primary vegetation, which are assumed to be not disturbed by human activities for a prolonged period. MSA is similar to the Biodiversity Integrity Index (Majer and Beeston 1996) and the Biodiversity Intactness Index (Scholes and Biggs 2005) and can be considered as a proxy for the CBD indicator on trends in species abundance (UNEP 2004). The main difference between MSA and BII is that every hectare is given equal weight in MSA, whereas BII gives more weight to species rich areas. MSA is also similar to the Living Planet Index (Loh and others 2005), which compares changes in populations to a 1970 baseline, rather than to primary vegetation. It should be emphasized that MSA does not completely cover the complex biodiversity concept, and complementary indicators should be included, when used in extensive biodiversity assessments (Faith and others 2008). \r\n\r\nThe output of GLOBIO is expressed here as MSA, an indicator of naturalness or biodiversity intactness. It is defined as the mean abundance of original species relative to their abundance in undisturbed ecosystems. An area with an MSA of 100% means a biodiversity that is similar to the natural situation. An MSA of 0% means a completely destructed ecosystem, with no original species remaining. Global environmental drivers of biodiversity change are input for GLOBIO3. In this particular case, a simplified method is used since not all required drivers are available for the historical period. Therefore, only historical land use changes are the main driver here. Long term historical expansion of cropland, pasture (land used for grazing livestock, intensive and extensive) and built-up area (urban sprawl, growth of cities and towns) are taken from the HYDE 3.1 database (Klein Goldewijk et al. 2011). GLOBIO3 calculates the overall MSAi value by substracting the individual MSAX maps from the potential maximum available grid cell land area (and dividing with it so a fraction is obtained): \r\n\r\nMSAi,t = (Gareai \u2013 0.7* Croplandi,t \u2013 0.3 *Pasturei,t \u2013 0.95 * Built-upi,t)/Gareai \r\n\r\nwhere i is a grid cell, t is (historical) time step, MSAi is the overall value for grid cell i, Gareai is the total available land area of grid cell i. Cropland, Pasture and Built-up are the corresponding historical land use areas at time step t. The multipliers are derived from expert judgment, indicating a very high negative impact on biodiversity (0.95), a severe impact (0.7) and a modest impact (0.3).\r\n"], "skos:note": "Mean species abundance index"}}, "http://datasets.socialhistory.org/api/access/datafile/130": {"datafile": {"originalFormatLabel": "UNKNOWN", "contentType": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet", "name": "Number_Workers_Labour_Conflicts-historical.xlsx", "filename": "1519f22a03c-c3a120895b5d", "id": 130, "md5": "5ad3530696d2c8121d77298e96cffdb3"}, "datasetVersionId": 42, "title": "Number of Workers Involved in Labour Disputes", "label": "Number_Workers_Labour_Conflicts-historical.xlsx", "version": 1, "metadata": {"prov:wasDerivedFrom": [{"@id": "http://hdl.handle.net/10622/M0PI4D"}], "dc:title": "Number of Workers Involved in Labour Disputes", "dc:description": ["This dataset provides the annual number of Labour conflicts in a number of countries since 1927.
